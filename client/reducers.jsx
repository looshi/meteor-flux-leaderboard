Optimistic UI
The 'UPDATE_SCORE' action will optimistically update the local state.
If the db update fails, state will be updated later via the UPDATE_SCORE_FAILED.
If the db update succeeds, but the score didn't actually get incremented by 5,
the state will be updated to display the real db score via PLAYERS_CHANGED.
